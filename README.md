bitcoin-passwords-brute-forcer
==============================

I've created this git repository because I had set a very difficult password for my Bitcoin wallet, and after a bit I forgot it.

A very simple password generator based on word chunks that might help to recover passwords. The original code for "test" method is from Revalin
